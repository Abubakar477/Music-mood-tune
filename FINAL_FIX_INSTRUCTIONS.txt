!!! IMPORTANT: YOU MUST DO THESE STEPS TO FIX THE LOGIN !!!

The error in your screenshot "Please configure Firebase..." means you skipped a required step. The app cannot log in because it doesn't know your Firebase project's ID.

STEP 1: GET YOUR WEB CLIENT ID
1. Open your browser and go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Click on your project "Music Player".
3. Click "Authentication" in the left menu.
4. Click the "Sign-in method" tab.
5. Click on "Google" (the row where it says Enabled).
6. Look for "Web SDK configuration".
7. Copy the long text under "Web client ID".
   It looks like this: 123456789-abcdefghijk.apps.googleusercontent.com

STEP 2: PASTE IT INTO THE APP
1. In Android Studio, open this file:
   app > src > main > res > values > strings.xml
2. Find this line:
   <string name="default_web_client_id">YOUR_WEB_CLIENT_ID_HERE</string>
3. Delete "YOUR_WEB_CLIENT_ID_HERE" and paste the ID you copied.
   It should look like:
   <string name="default_web_client_id">123456789-abcdefghijk.apps.googleusercontent.com</string>

STEP 3: FIX THE "CONNECTION ERROR" (SHA-1 KEY)
If the loading spinner spins forever and says "Connection Timeout", you are missing the SHA-1 Key.
1. In Android Studio, look at the Right Sidebar and click "Gradle".
2. Open the folders: Music Player > Tasks > android > signingReport.
3. Double-click "signingReport".
4. Look at the text output at the bottom of the screen.
5. Find "SHA1: 5E:8F:16:..." (it's a long code with numbers and colons). Copy it.
6. Go back to Firebase Console (website).
7. Click the Gear Icon (Settings) > Project Settings.
8. Scroll down to "Your apps".
9. Click "Add fingerprint".
10. Paste the SHA1 key and save.
11. VERY IMPORTANT: Download "google-services.json" again and replace the file in your "app" folder.

STEP 4: FIX EMULATOR INTERNET
If it still fails, your emulator might not have internet.
1. Close the emulator.
2. Open Android Studio Device Manager.
3. Click the 3 dots next to your emulator > "Wipe Data".
4. Start the emulator again.

NOW RUN THE APP. IT WILL WORK.
