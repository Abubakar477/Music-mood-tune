🎵 MoodTune
The Intelligent, Emotion-Aware Android Music Player
MoodTune is an intelligent Android music player designed to bridge the gap between human emotion and digital entertainment. By offering a "Zero-Friction" experience, MoodTune eliminates the need to manually scroll through endless lists to find a song that fits your vibe. Instead, it listens to how you feel.

🚀 Overview
Traditional music players are passive; MoodTune is reactive. Operating on a Hybrid Model, the application utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to automatically detect your mood via facial scanning. For users who prefer a hands-on approach, it also offers a Manual Mood Bar for precise control.

Whether you are streaming via Spotify or listening to offline Local Storage, MoodTune creates dynamic, color-adaptive playlists that align perfectly with your current emotional state.
